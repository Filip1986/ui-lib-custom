# Competitive Benchmarks

> **Evidence file for Scoring Category 11 — Competitive Parity & Differentiation.**
> Every component that reaches production quality must have an entry in this file.
> The scoring criteria live in [`docs/SCORING_CRITERIA.md`](SCORING_CRITERIA.md).

---

## Purpose

This file answers two questions for every component:

1. **Parity** — does this component do everything the best competing implementations do?
2. **Beyond** — where does it go further than any of them?

It is not a marketing document. It is an engineering audit. Gaps are documented honestly.
Exclusions are justified with a reason. Differentiators are stated precisely.

---

## Reference Libraries

| Library | Why it is a benchmark | Docs |
|---|---|---|
| **Angular Material** | The Angular-native incumbent. Canonical baseline for what Angular developers expect. | material.angular.io |
| **PrimeNG** | The most feature-complete Angular UI library in active use. The feature-richness baseline. | primeng.org |
| **Radix UI** | The accessibility gold standard in any framework. Built directly around WAI-ARIA APG patterns. If Radix does it, it is correct. | radix-ui.com/primitives |
| **Ark UI** | Modern headless component library (React/Vue/Solid). Best composability and API shape reference. | ark-ui.com |
| **Melt UI** | Headless Svelte library. Best reference for builder-pattern composability and slot architecture. | melt-ui.com |

---

## Legend

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ | Implemented — at full parity with the reference |
| 🚀 | **Beyond** — this library does something the reference does not, or does it better |
| ⚠️ | Partial — implemented but incomplete or with a known limitation |
| ❌ | Gap — reference has this; this library does not yet — active backlog item |
| `—` Excluded | Consciously decided not to implement — reason documented inline |
| `N/A` | The reference library has no equivalent or the concept does not apply |

**A component only passes Category 11 when there are zero unresolved ❌ gaps.**
A `—` Excluded entry is not a gap — it is a decision. Gaps that are accepted must be promoted to exclusions with a written reason.

---

## Library-Wide Differentiators

These are capabilities that apply to **every** component in this library and that no Angular
reference library currently offers. They count toward the 🚀 "no reference library offers this"
checkbox for every component automatically — you do not need to re-document them per component.

| Differentiator | Angular Material | PrimeNG | Radix UI | Ark UI | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Signal-native inputs (`input()`, `model()`, `output()`) | ❌ uses `@Input()` | ❌ uses `@Input()` | N/A | N/A | Angular 17+ signal API throughout |
| Zoneless-compatible (`provideZonelessChangeDetection()`) | ⚠️ partial | ❌ | N/A | N/A | Every component tested zoneless |
| SSR-safe out of the box (no `document`/`window` on server) | ✅ | ⚠️ partial | N/A | N/A | Guards enforced by convention |
| Three runtime visual variants (material / bootstrap / minimal) | ❌ one design system | ❌ one design system | ❌ unstyled only | ❌ unstyled only | Variant switchable at runtime |
| Design-token-driven via CSS custom properties (`--uilib-*`) | ⚠️ uses MDC tokens, less flexible | ⚠️ partial token coverage | ❌ | ❌ | Full token surface exposed |
| `ViewEncapsulation.None` — cascade-friendly, no `::ng-deep` needed | ❌ Emulated encapsulation | ❌ Emulated encapsulation | N/A | N/A | Consumer can override freely |
| Standalone-only, no NgModule | ✅ (recent) | ✅ (recent) | N/A | N/A | Native from day one |
| Angular block syntax (`@if`, `@for`, `@switch`) throughout | ⚠️ migrating | ⚠️ migrating | N/A | N/A | 100% block syntax from day one |

## Per-Component Comparison Tables

Add a new entry for each component when it enters the hardening workflow.
Entries are in alphabetical order within each category grouping.

---

### How to Fill In a New Entry

1. Find the equivalent component in each reference library (or note `N/A`).
2. Read its full feature list, input/output API, keyboard model, and ARIA implementation.
3. For each row: mark ✅ ❌ ⚠️ 🚀 or N/A. Be honest.
4. Add a **Gaps** section listing every ❌ row and the decision: implement it or exclude it with a reason.
5. Add a **Differentiators** section listing every 🚀 row with a one-sentence explanation.
6. Record the reference URLs at the bottom of the entry.

---

### Template

```markdown
### ComponentName

| Feature / Behaviour | Angular Material | PrimeNG | Radix UI | Ark UI | **ui-lib-custom** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Feature description | ✅/❌/⚠️/N/A | ✅/❌/⚠️/N/A | ✅/❌/⚠️/N/A | ✅/❌/⚠️/N/A | ✅/🚀/⚠️/❌ |

#### Gaps (❌ rows — must be resolved before Category 11 passes)
- **Feature name**: [implement by date] / [— Excluded: reason]

#### Differentiators (🚀 rows)
- **Feature name**: [one sentence explaining what this library does that the reference does not]

#### Reference URLs
- Angular Material: [URL or "no equivalent"]
- PrimeNG: [URL or "no equivalent"]
- Radix UI: [URL or "no equivalent"]
- Ark UI: [URL or "no equivalent"]
- APG Pattern: [URL]
```

## Core Inputs

---

### Button

| Feature / Behaviour | Angular Material | PrimeNG | Radix UI | Ark UI | **ui-lib-custom** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Filled / solid variant | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Outlined variant | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Text / ghost variant | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Size variants (sm / md / lg) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Icon-only button | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Icon + label button | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Leading icon slot | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Trailing icon slot | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Loading / busy state | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `aria-busy` on loading | ❌ | ⚠️ | ❌ | ⚠️ | 🚀 |
| `aria-disabled` (not HTML `disabled`) | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Ripple effect | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Danger / destructive severity | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Link-style button (`routerLink` compatible) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Signal-native API (`input()`) | ❌ | ❌ | N/A | N/A | 🚀 |
| Zoneless compatible | ❌ | ❌ | N/A | N/A | 🚀 |
| Three runtime visual variants | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | 🚀 |

#### Gaps
_None — all ❌ reference rows are matched or consciously excluded._

#### Differentiators
- **`aria-busy` on loading**: Angular Material and PrimeNG set a visual spinner but do not set `aria-busy="true"` on the button element, so screen readers do not announce the busy state. This library sets it correctly.
- **Signal-native API**: Both Angular incumbents use `@Input()` decorators. This library uses `input()` / `model()` throughout, enabling signal composition with no adapter layer.
- **Three runtime visual variants**: No other Angular library lets you switch between Material, Bootstrap, and Minimal aesthetics at runtime via a single CSS variable change.

### Select

| Feature / Behaviour | Angular Material | PrimeNG | Radix UI | Ark UI | **ui-lib-custom** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Single selection | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Multi-selection with chips | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Searchable / filterable options | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Option groups | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Custom option template | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Custom trigger / selected-value template | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Virtualized option list | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| APG Combobox keyboard model (arrows, Home/End, type-ahead) | ✅ | ⚠️ partial | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `aria-activedescendant` pattern | ✅ | ⚠️ partial | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `aria-expanded` on trigger | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Focus returns to trigger on close | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `ControlValueAccessor` (Reactive Forms) | ✅ | ✅ | N/A | N/A | ✅ |
| `disabled` individual options | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Loading state for async options | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Signal-native API (`input()`) | ❌ | ❌ | N/A | N/A | 🚀 |
| Zoneless compatible | ❌ | ❌ | N/A | N/A | 🚀 |
| Three runtime visual variants | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | 🚀 |

#### Gaps
_None — all ❌ reference rows are matched or consciously excluded._

#### Differentiators
- **Virtualized option list**: Angular Material's Select does not virtualize long lists. This library renders only the visible options for unbounded datasets.
- **Loading state for async options**: A first-class loading input that shows a spinner inside the panel — none of the React-ecosystem libraries support this natively.
- **Signal-native API**: Full `input()` / `model()` — consumers get type-safe signal composition for free.

### Input

| Feature / Behaviour | Angular Material | PrimeNG | Radix UI | Ark UI | **ui-lib-custom** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Text, email, password, number types | ✅ | ✅ | N/A | N/A | ✅ |
| Label association (`<label for>` or `aria-labelledby`) | ✅ | ✅ | N/A | N/A | ✅ |
| Floating label | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Prefix / suffix icon slots | ✅ | ✅ | N/A | N/A | ✅ |
| Prefix / suffix text slots | ✅ | ✅ | N/A | N/A | ✅ |
| Helper text below input | ✅ | ✅ | N/A | N/A | ✅ |
| Error message via `aria-describedby` | ✅ | ⚠️ | N/A | N/A | ✅ |
| `aria-invalid` on error state | ✅ | ⚠️ | N/A | N/A | ✅ |
| Character count | ❌ | ✅ | N/A | N/A | ✅ |
| `ControlValueAccessor` | ✅ | ✅ | N/A | N/A | ✅ |
| Clearable (× button) | ❌ | ✅ | N/A | N/A | ✅ |
| Password visibility toggle with accessible label | ⚠️ | ✅ | N/A | N/A | ✅ |
| Signal-native API | ❌ | ❌ | N/A | N/A | 🚀 |
| Zoneless compatible | ❌ | ❌ | N/A | N/A | 🚀 |
| Three runtime visual variants | ❌ | ❌ | N/A | N/A | 🚀 |

#### Gaps
_None._

#### Differentiators
- **Error message via `aria-describedby`**: PrimeNG attaches validation messages visually but does not consistently wire `aria-describedby` on the input to the error element. This library wires it correctly and cleans up the reference when the error clears.

#### Reference URLs
- Angular Material: https://material.angular.io/components/input/overview
- PrimeNG: https://primeng.org/inputtext
- Radix UI: N/A (no form input primitive — uses native `<input>`)
- Ark UI: https://ark-ui.com/react/docs/components/pin-input (closest)
- APG Pattern: https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/textbox/ (native `<input>` — ARIA authoring notes apply)

### Dialog

| Feature / Behaviour | Angular Material | PrimeNG | Radix UI | Ark UI | **ui-lib-custom** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `role=dialog` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `aria-modal=true` | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `aria-labelledby` wired to header | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `aria-describedby` wired to body | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Focus trap (CDK or equivalent) | ✅ | ⚠️ partial | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Initial focus on first focusable element | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Focus returns to trigger on close | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Escape key closes dialog | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Backdrop click closes dialog (configurable) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Scroll lock on open | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Enter / exit animations | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `prefers-reduced-motion` respected | ⚠️ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Maximisable | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Draggable / resizable | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Programmatic open / close API (service-based) | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Signal-native API | ❌ | ❌ | N/A | N/A | 🚀 |
| Zoneless compatible | ❌ | ❌ | N/A | N/A | 🚀 |
| Three runtime visual variants | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | 🚀 |

#### Gaps
_None._

#### Differentiators
- **`aria-describedby` wired to body**: PrimeNG does not wire `aria-describedby` on the dialog element to its body region. Screen readers therefore do not automatically read the dialog content on open. This library wires it correctly.
- **`prefers-reduced-motion`**: PrimeNG dialog animations do not respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. This library suppresses or replaces all dialog animations when reduced motion is preferred.

### Tabs

| Feature / Behaviour | Angular Material | PrimeNG | Radix UI | Ark UI | **ui-lib-custom** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `role=tablist` / `role=tab` / `role=tabpanel` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `aria-selected` on active tab | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `aria-controls` tab → panel | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `aria-labelledby` panel → tab | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Arrow key navigation (left/right) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Home / End key navigation | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Disabled tab (not focusable, `aria-disabled`) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Lazy tab panel rendering | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Scrollable tab strip (overflow) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Closable / removable tabs | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Tab with icon | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Tab with badge count | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Signal-native API | ❌ | ❌ | N/A | N/A | 🚀 |

### Table

| Feature / Behaviour | Angular Material | PrimeNG | Radix UI | Ark UI | **ui-lib-custom** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `role=grid` | ⚠️ uses `role=table` | ✅ | N/A | N/A | ✅ |
| Sortable columns (`aria-sort`) | ✅ | ✅ | N/A | N/A | ✅ |
| Row selection (`aria-selected`) | ✅ | ✅ | N/A | N/A | ✅ |
| Multi-row selection with checkbox | ✅ | ✅ | N/A | N/A | ✅ |
| Column resizing | ❌ | ✅ | N/A | N/A | ✅ |
| Column reordering | ❌ | ✅ | N/A | N/A | ✅ |
| Row expansion | ❌ | ✅ | N/A | N/A | ✅ |
| Frozen / sticky columns | ❌ | ✅ | N/A | N/A | ✅ |
| Virtual scrolling (rows) | ❌ | ✅ | N/A | N/A | ✅ |
| Paginator integration | ✅ | ✅ | N/A | N/A | ✅ |
| Row reordering (drag) | ❌ | ✅ | N/A | N/A | ✅ |
| Keyboard row navigation (arrow keys) | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | N/A | N/A | ✅ |
| Live region for sort / filter change announcements | ❌ | ❌ | N/A | N/A | 🚀 |
| Signal-native API | ❌ | ❌ | N/A | N/A | 🚀 |
| Zoneless compatible | ❌ | ❌ | N/A | N/A | 🚀 |
| Three runtime visual variants | ❌ | ❌ | N/A | N/A | 🚀 |

#### Gaps
_None._

#### Differentiators
- **`role=grid`**: Angular Material's `mat-table` uses `role=table` which is read-only semantics. A grid (`role=grid`) communicates interactive rows correctly to screen readers, enabling proper navigation announcements.
- **Live region for sort / filter announcements**: Neither Angular Material nor PrimeNG announces sort direction changes or filter result counts to screen readers. This library uses a live region to announce these state changes.

## Adding New Entries

When a component completes Phase 2 (DX & API) of the hardening workflow:

1. Copy the template from the "How to Fill In a New Entry" section above.
2. Research each reference library — spend at least 15 minutes on each.
3. Fill in every row with a definitive symbol — no blanks left.
4. Resolve all ❌ gaps: implement the feature or write a one-line exclusion reason.
5. Write at least one 🚀 Differentiator entry — if you cannot find one, look harder.
6. Record the URLs.
7. Update the component's Category 11 score in `COMPONENT_SCORES.md`.

The comparison table for a component is never "done" — re-check it when:
- A reference library ships a major new version
- A new API input is added to this component
- An a11y gap is reported by a user or an axe-core audit
