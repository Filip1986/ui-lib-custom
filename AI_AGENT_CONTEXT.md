# AI Agent Context

> Active session context only.
> Stable architecture, conventions, and workflows live in `AGENTS.md`.

## Purpose and Scope

Use this file for:
- Current focus, queue, and blockers
- Quick status deltas for in-flight components/docs
- Recent handoffs (latest 1-3 sessions)

Do not duplicate stable project rules here; link to `AGENTS.md` instead.

## Active Session State

- **Current milestone:** Component foundation hardening + documentation completeness
- **Active focus:** Table accessibility hardening COMPLETE (6-phase, #32); next is TreeTable (#33, Tier 4 Data Display)
- **Next queue:** TreeTable hardening (Tier 4, #33) — `role=treegrid`, hierarchy semantics, expanded state, keyboard navigation
- **Horizon:** Runtime variant switcher, theme preset management, broader axe-core audit ✅ (infra in place)

- `Table` -> ✅ complete + hardened (6-phase, 125 tests — 92 unit + 33 a11y)

## Known Blockers / Watch Items

- Non-blocking Jest warning seen during a11y run:
  - `jest-haste-map: Haste module naming collision: ui-lib-custom`
  - between root `package.json` and `projects/ui-lib-custom/package.json`
- Demo build shows pre-existing SCSS budget warnings in `button` and `date-picker` -- not a blocker

## Recent Handoffs

Date: 2026-05-11 [Avatar component — accessibility hardening COMPLETE (#65)]
Changed:
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/avatar/avatar.ts
      • Added unique instance IDs, full-name `name` input, image-alt fallback resolution, and automatic `listitem` role when nested in AvatarGroup
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/avatar/avatar.html
      • Switched image alt binding to computed fallback alt (`imageAlt` → `name` → `label` → `Avatar`)
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/avatar/avatar.scss
      • Added `:focus-visible` treatment and `prefers-reduced-motion` safety override
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/avatar/avatar-group.ts
      • Added unique group IDs, `role=list`, overflow inputs/announcement text, and AvatarGroup DI context token
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/avatar/avatar-group.html
      • Added accessible `+N` overflow listitem
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/avatar/avatar-group.scss
      • Added overflow badge styles and reduced-motion override
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/avatar/avatar.spec.ts
      • Updated group role expectation to `list` and added overflow/fallback assertions
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/avatar/avatar.a11y.spec.ts (CREATED — 16 tests)
      • Added ARIA structure, label fallback, decorative internals, grouped-list semantics, unique-id, and axe coverage
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/avatar/README.md
      • Expanded API docs with `name` and group overflow inputs, plus ARIA/keyboard/CSS variable sections
  - docs/COMPONENT_SCORES.md
      • Avatar #65 moved from ⏳ Queued to ✅ Done with completed score row (avg 8.2)
State: Avatar hardening is complete. Alt propagation, icon/initial naming, grouped list semantics, overflow announcement labeling, reduced-motion guardrails, and dedicated a11y regression coverage are in place.
Verification:
  node_modules/.bin/eslint projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/avatar/ --max-warnings 0 (PASS)
  node_modules/.bin/jest --testPathPatterns=avatar --no-coverage (36/36 PASS)
  node_modules/.bin/ng build ui-lib-custom (PASS)
  node_modules/.bin/jest --testPathPatterns=entry-points --no-coverage (97/97 PASS)
Terminal notes: `node_modules` was missing in the fresh clone; ran `npm install` first. Took manual demo screenshot at `/tmp/avatar-demo.png` after launching `npm run serve:demo`.
Next step: Resume backlog sequence after Avatar #65 completion.

Date: 2026-05-11 [Latest merge conflict verification for table hardening PR]
Changed:
  - AI_AGENT_CONTEXT.md
      • Resolved the newest conflict against origin/main by preserving the current Table → TreeTable session state
      • Kept active handoffs trimmed to the newest three entries and moved the older Stepper handoff to the archive
State: Branch is merged with the latest origin/main again. This merge only required resolving AI_AGENT_CONTEXT.md; no library source files changed in the incoming main branch.
Verification:
  node_modules/.bin/jest --testPathPatterns=entry-points --no-coverage (97/97 PASS)
  npm run typecheck (PASS)
  node_modules/.bin/ng build ui-lib-custom (PASS)
Terminal notes: The repository is now fully unshallowed locally after `git fetch --unshallow origin`; merge conflict was isolated to AI_AGENT_CONTEXT.md.
Next step: TreeTable (#33) hardening — start Tier 4 Data Display treegrid pass.

Date: 2026-05-11 [Merge conflict resolution refresh for table hardening PR]
Changed:
  - AI_AGENT_CONTEXT.md
      • Resolved the new conflict against origin/main by keeping the latest Table → TreeTable session state
      • Preserved the incoming Stepper hardening handoff and trimmed active handoffs back to the newest three entries
  - docs/COMPONENT_SCORES.md
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/stepper/README.md
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/stepper/index.ts
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/stepper/stepper-panel.ts
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/stepper/stepper.a11y.spec.ts
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/stepper/stepper.html
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/stepper/stepper.scss
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/stepper/stepper.spec.ts
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/stepper/stepper.ts
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/stepper/stepper.types.ts
      • Brought in the latest origin/main Stepper hardening changes as part of the merge
State: Branch is merged with the latest origin/main again. The only manual conflict resolution was in AI_AGENT_CONTEXT.md; incoming Stepper changes are preserved as-is.
Verification:
  node_modules/.bin/eslint projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/stepper/ --max-warnings 0 (PASS)
  node_modules/.bin/jest --testPathPatterns=stepper --no-coverage (61/61 PASS)
  node_modules/.bin/jest --testPathPatterns=entry-points --no-coverage (97/97 PASS)
  npm run typecheck (PASS)
  node_modules/.bin/ng build ui-lib-custom (PASS)
Terminal notes: Fresh clone again required `npm install` before local validation because `node_modules/.bin/*` tools were absent.
Next step: TreeTable (#33) hardening — start Tier 4 Data Display treegrid pass.
