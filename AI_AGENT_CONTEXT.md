## Purpose and Scope

Use this file for:
- Current focus, queue, and blockers
- Quick status deltas for in-flight components/docs
- Recent handoffs (latest 1-3 sessions)

Do not duplicate stable project rules here; link to `AGENTS.md` instead.

## Known Blockers / Watch Items

- Non-blocking Jest warning seen during a11y run:
  - `jest-haste-map: Haste module naming collision: ui-lib-custom`
  - between root `package.json` and `projects/ui-lib-custom/package.json`
- Demo build shows pre-existing SCSS budget warnings in `button` and `date-picker` -- not a blocker

## Recent Handoffs

Date: 2026-05-12 [Merge conflicts resolved for TreeSelect accessibility PR]
Changed:
  - AI_AGENT_CONTEXT.md
  - docs/COMPONENT_SCORES.md
  - docs/implementation/AI_AGENT_CONTEXT_ARCHIVE.md
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/tree/tree.ts
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/tree/tree.html
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/tree/tree-node.ts
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/tree/tree-node.html
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/tree/tree.scss
State: Merged the latest `origin/main` into the TreeSelect accessibility branch again, reconciled the repeated Tree/docs conflicts, preserved the already-validated TreeSelect + Tree accessibility behavior, and kept the newer bookkeeping from `main` (including Terminal status and the TreeTable archive entry).
Verification:
  node_modules/.bin/eslint projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/tree/ projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/tree-select/ --max-warnings 0 (PASS)
  node_modules/.bin/jest --testPathPatterns='src/lib/tree/|tree-select' --no-coverage (172/172 PASS)
  node_modules/.bin/ng build ui-lib-custom (PASS, zero errors)
  node_modules/.bin/jest --testPathPatterns=entry-points --no-coverage (97/97 PASS)
Terminal notes: `origin/main` advanced again after the previous merge resolution, so a fifth merge + conflict pass was required.
Next step: Commit the refreshed merge resolution and reply on the PR thread with the new merge commit hash.

Date: 2026-05-12 [Skeleton PR — merge conflict resolution COMPLETE (round 2)]
Changed:
  - AI_AGENT_CONTEXT.md
      • Resolved additive handoff conflict with the new ScrollTop entry from `origin/main`
      • Archived older ScrollPanel and TreeTable handoffs so the active context keeps only the newest 3 entries
  - docs/implementation/AI_AGENT_CONTEXT_ARCHIVE.md
      • Preserved Skeleton, Upload, MeterGroup, and Panel archive entries from both sides of the merge
State: The Skeleton PR branch now has a true merge commit against `origin/main` at `0d3bf39`. This round of conflicts was limited to session-context bookkeeping files only.
Verification:
  npm run typecheck (PASS)
Terminal notes: Fresh clone was shallow again, so `git fetch --unshallow origin` and `git fetch origin main:refs/remotes/origin/main` were required before performing the merge.
Next step: No further action for this PR unless `origin/main` advances again and introduces new conflicts.

Date: 2026-05-12 [ScrollTop component — accessibility hardening COMPLETE (#75)]
Changed:
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/scroll-top/scroll-top.ts
      • Added module-level `nextScrollTopId` counter and unique host `scrollTopId`
      • Switched window access to `DOCUMENT`/`defaultView` for SSR-safe scroll handling
      • Added non-empty `resolvedButtonAriaLabel` fallback (`'Scroll to top'`)
      • Synced initial visibility on init and kept hidden state reflected through host `aria-hidden`
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/scroll-top/scroll-top.html
      • Added hidden-state `aria-hidden` + `tabindex="-1"` handling on the button
      • Bound button aria-label to the resolved non-empty label
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/scroll-top/scroll-top.scss
      • Kept the existing focus-visible ring, added reduced-motion overrides, and added dark-mode overrides for material/bootstrap variants
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/scroll-top/scroll-top.spec.ts
      • Updated default aria-label expectations and added coverage for fallback labels, hidden focusability, icon aria-hidden, and unique host ids
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/scroll-top/scroll-top.a11y.spec.ts (CREATED — 14 tests)
      • Added ARIA structure, hidden/visible keyboard focusability, unique ids, threshold visibility, parent-target visibility, and axe-core coverage
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/scroll-top/README.md
      • Expanded CSS custom properties documentation, ARIA table, keyboard table, and accessibility notes
  - projects/demo/src/app/pages/scroll-top/scroll-top-demo.component.html
      • Updated API table docs to reflect the new default button aria-label
  - docs/COMPONENT_SCORES.md
      • ScrollTop #75: ⏳ Queued → ✅ Done
      • Utilities & Directives table populated (API 8, A11y 9, Perf 8, Comp 8, Theme 9, DX 8, Docs 9, Polish 8, Angular 9, Feel 8 — avg 8.4)
State: ScrollTop hardening complete. Hidden instances are now removed from the accessibility tree and tab order, the default label is guaranteed for the icon-only button, unique ids and SSR-safe scroll access are in place, and dedicated a11y regression coverage was added.
Verification:
  node_modules/.bin/eslint projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/scroll-top/ --max-warnings 0 (PASS)
  node_modules/.bin/jest --testPathPatterns=scroll-top --no-coverage (37/37 PASS — 23 unit + 14 a11y)
  node_modules/.bin/ng build ui-lib-custom (PASS, zero errors)
  node_modules/.bin/jest --testPathPatterns=entry-points --no-coverage (97/97 PASS)
Terminal notes: Fresh clone required `npm install` before validation tools were available. Screenshot captured at `/tmp/scroll-top-hardening.png`.
Next step: TreeTable (#33) hardening — Tier 4 Data Display treegrid pass.
