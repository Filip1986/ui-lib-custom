# AI Agent Context

> Active session context only.

## Purpose and Scope

Use this file for:
- Current focus, queue, and blockers
- Quick status deltas for in-flight components/docs
- Recent handoffs (latest 1-3 sessions)

Do not duplicate stable project rules here; link to `AGENTS.md` instead.

---

## Active Session State

- **Current milestone:** Component foundation hardening + documentation completeness
- **Active focus:** Documentation gap-filling and polish after InputMask completion
- **Next queue:** `knip` baseline and dead-code cleanup, constants extraction pass, overlay follow-ups (`appendTo`/z-index manager)
- **Horizon:** Runtime variant switcher, theme preset management, Storybook integration, broader axe-core audit

### Component/Docs Delta (Active Only)

- `InputMask` -> ✅ complete (implementation/tests/demo/docs/entry-point verification done)
- `InputNumber` -> ✅ complete (implementation/tests/entry-point/demo/docs/final QA complete)
- Documentation gaps still tracked for: `Input`, `Select`, `Card`, `Layout`
- Pending secondary entry points: `icon-button`, `alert`

---

## Known Blockers / Watch Items

- Non-blocking Jest warning seen during a11y run:
  - `jest-haste-map: Haste module naming collision: ui-lib-custom`
  - between root `package.json` and `projects/ui-lib-custom/package.json`
- Demo build may show pre-existing SCSS budget warnings in `button` and `date-picker` (not introduced by current InputMask work)

## Recent Handoffs

Older handoffs are archived in `docs/implementation/AI_AGENT_CONTEXT_ARCHIVE.md`.

```text
Date: 2026-04-08
Changed: docs/reference/components/INPUTNUMBER.md, docs/reference/components/README.md, projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/input-number/input-number.component.ts, projects/demo/src/app/pages/input-number/input-number-demo.component.ts, projects/demo/src/app/pages/input-number/input-number-demo.component.html, projects/demo/src/app/pages/input-number/input-number-demo.component.scss, projects/demo/src/app/app.routes.ts, projects/demo/src/app/layout/sidebar/sidebar.component.ts, AI_AGENT_CONTEXT.md, docs/implementation/AI_AGENT_CONTEXT_ARCHIVE.md
State: InputNumber: Prompt 8 complete. Fully implemented, tested, documented, and demoed. Next: Backlog follow-ups / v2 hardening only.
Verification:
- Library build passed: `npx ng build ui-lib-custom`.
- Tests passed: `npx jest input-number --coverage --runInBand --no-cache` (InputNumber coverage: 96.55% statements, 87.5% branches, 100% functions, 96.51% lines).
- Lint passed: `npx eslint projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/input-number/`.
- Demo serve command executed: `npx ng serve demo --no-open` (dev server compiled; existing local server remains on port 4200).
- Route check passed: `curl -I http://localhost:4200/input-number` returned HTTP 200.
Known issues / v2 considerations:
- Pre-existing non-blocking watch items remain (Jest haste-map naming collision warning; demo SCSS budget warnings for `button` and `date-picker`).
- Runtime/manual visual + SR announcement checks still recommended for full UX sign-off across all 17 InputNumber demo sections.
Next step: Shift focus to queued backlog (`knip`, constants cleanup, overlay follow-ups) unless new InputNumber regressions appear.

Date: 2026-04-08
Changed: projects/demo/src/app/pages/input-number/input-number-demo.component.ts, projects/demo/src/app/pages/input-number/input-number-demo.component.html, projects/demo/src/app/pages/input-number/input-number-demo.component.scss, projects/demo/src/app/app.routes.ts, projects/demo/src/app/layout/sidebar/sidebar.component.ts, AI_AGENT_CONTEXT.md, docs/implementation/AI_AGENT_CONTEXT_ARCHIVE.md
State: InputNumber: Prompt 7 complete. Demo page with 17 scenarios. Next: Prompt 8 (documentation & final QA).
Verification:
- Added `InputNumberDemoComponent` page with 17 sections covering numerals, formatting/locale/currency, prefix/suffix, spinner layouts, step/min-max, float-label, clear, sizes, states, filled, fluid, and reactive forms.
- Added lazy route in `projects/demo/src/app/app.routes.ts` for `/input-number`.
- Added sidebar form-navigation item in `projects/demo/src/app/layout/sidebar/sidebar.component.ts`.
- Demo build passed: `npx ng build demo`.
- Demo server route check responded with HTTP 200: `curl -I http://localhost:4200/input-number` (local server was already bound on port 4200).
Next step: Prompt 8 documentation updates and final QA sweep.

State: InputNumber: Prompt 6 complete. Secondary entry point `ui-lib-custom/input-number` wired and building. Next: Prompt 7 (demo page).
Verification:
- Added secondary entry-point metadata files under `projects/ui-lib-custom/input-number/` (`ng-package.json`, `package.json`).
- Updated entry-point import regression test in `projects/ui-lib-custom/test/entry-points.spec.ts` to include `ui-lib-custom/input-number`.
- Verified `projects/ui-lib-custom/src/public-api.ts` does not re-export `input-number`.
- Build command passed: `npx ng build ui-lib-custom` (includes `ui-lib-custom/input-number` entry point).
- Targeted entry-point test passed: `npx jest projects/ui-lib-custom/test/entry-points.spec.ts --runInBand --no-cache`.
Next step: Prompt 7 demo page integration for InputNumber.

## Rollover Rule

At end of session:
1. Append one concise handoff block to `## Recent Handoffs`.
2. Keep only the newest 3 handoffs here.
3. Move older handoffs to `docs/implementation/AI_AGENT_CONTEXT_ARCHIVE.md`.
4. Keep stable rule/process updates in `AGENTS.md` only.
