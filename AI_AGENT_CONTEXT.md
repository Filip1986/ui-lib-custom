# AI Agent Context

> Active session context only.
> Stable architecture, conventions, and workflows live in `AGENTS.md`.
> Historical handoffs live in `docs/implementation/AI_AGENT_CONTEXT_ARCHIVE.md`.

## Purpose and Scope

Use this file for:
- Current focus, queue, and blockers
- Quick status deltas for in-flight components/docs
- Recent handoffs (latest 1-3 sessions)

Do not duplicate stable project rules here; link to `AGENTS.md` instead.

## Active Session State

- **Current milestone:** Component foundation hardening + documentation completeness
- **Active focus:** ALL components hardened — 76 original queue items + all new components COMPLETE. Library hardening milestone achieved 2026-05-15.
- **Next queue:** No remaining hardening items. Next milestone: runtime variant switcher, theme preset management, broader axe-core audit.
- **Horizon:** Runtime variant switcher, theme preset management, broader axe-core audit ✅ (infra in place)
- **Prompt library status:** All Tier 1 hardening prompts deleted (one-time-use scaffolding — lessons distilled into `docs/prompts/COMPONENT_EVOLUTION_PROMPTS.md`). Active prompt system: `docs/prompts/audit/` (3-phase agentic Tier 2 audit). Score index: `docs/prompts/HARDENING_PROMPT_INDEX.md`.

## Known Blockers / Watch Items

- Non-blocking Jest warning seen during a11y run:
  - `jest-haste-map: Haste module naming collision: ui-lib-custom`
  - between root `package.json` and `projects/ui-lib-custom/package.json`
- Demo build shows pre-existing SCSS budget warnings in `button` and `date-picker` -- not a blocker

## Recent Handoffs

Date: 2026-05-24 [naming convention audit — critical output renames + conventions doc hardening]
Changed:
  color-picker.ts: change → colorChange (output + emit)
  color-picker.spec.ts: component.change → component.colorChange (4 references)
  slider.ts: change → sliderChange (output + 3 emits)
  toggle-button.ts: change/focus/blur → toggleButtonChange/toggleButtonFocus/toggleButtonBlur (declarations + emits)
  toggle-switch.ts: change/focus/blur → switchChange/switchFocus/switchBlur (declarations + emits + internal comment)
  autocomplete.ts: keyUp → autocompleteKeyUp (output + emit)
  virtual-scroller.component.ts: scroll → virtualScroll (output + emit)
  galleria.ts: removed duplicate explicit activeIndexChange output (model() already emits it); removed output import + OutputEmitterRef type
  toggle-button-demo.component.html: (change)→(toggleButtonChange) binding + description text
  toggle-button-demo.component.ts: event log string updated
  autocomplete-demo.component.ts: API table — select→optionSelect, focus→autocompleteFocus, blur→autocompleteBlur; added autocompleteKeyUp
  LIBRARY_CONVENTIONS.md: Rule 1 example fixed (was accidentally showing focus/change as correct); Rule 2 camelCase note added; canonical output names reference table added
State: ng build → PASS (40 924ms); eslint → 0 warnings on all changed files
Verification: npm run build (PASS), npx eslint 12 changed files --max-warnings 0 (PASS)
Next step: Fix medium issues from audit — add `readonly` to order-list and pick-list model() signals; replace CommonModule with specific directive imports in 18 components

Date: 2026-05-24 [themes refactor — shape-pill token, dark mixin deduplication, themes.css full rewrite]
Changed:
  themes.scss: added --uilib-shape-pill: 9999px to universal tokens; wired --uilib-radius-full to it;
    replaced duplicate sections 3 and 3b with @mixin dark-theme-tokens — single source of truth for
    all dark overrides; OS prefers-color-scheme fallback was missing 26 tokens (fixed)
  themes.css: full rewrite — universal tokens in :root only; [data-theme='dark'] trimmed to overrides
    only (removed ~110 lines of duplicated spacing/layout tokens); added @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)
    block that was completely absent; added @layer declarations; added missing tokens (shape, radius, 
    font-size, icon sizes, transitions, focus-ring, shadows, dialog, input, select, checkbox, accordion, badge)
  AI_AGENT_CONTEXT.md: handoff updated
State: 6040/6040 tests passing; ng build → PASS; typecheck → PASS; all 7 tasks marked completed
Verification: npm test (6040/6040), npm run build (PASS), git push → pre-push typecheck PASS
Terminal notes: none
Next step: No open tasks. Next milestone candidates: broader component axe-core audit pass, new premium
  component (signals-first data grid is highest-value per VISION.md), or theme preset UI improvements.

Date: 2026-05-24 [SCSS token cleanup — component-scoped tokens, :root removal, :host fix, task list cleared]
Changed:
  badge.scss: added --uilib-badge-radius / --uilib-badge-radius-pill / --uilib-badge-radius-dot intermediate
    tokens; pill now defaults to 9999px, dot to 50%, both still inherit from --uilib-shape-base
  animate-on-scroll.scss: removed :root { --uilib-animate-on-scroll-* } block; moved token defaults
    onto a grouped .uilib-aos-* selector so they're scoped to the elements that consume them
  editor.scss: replaced all 25 :host(.ui-lib-editor--*) selectors with ui-lib-editor.ui-lib-editor--*
    — :host() is a no-op under ViewEncapsulation.None; state/variant/size rules were previously inert
  Task list: #2 #3 #4 #5 #6 #7 all marked completed (task #5 / _theme-mixins.scss was already deleted;
    tasks #6 and #7 were shipped in prior sessions)
State: 25/25 badge + 45/45 editor tests pass; ng build → PASS; typecheck → PASS; eslint → 0 warnings
Verification: node_modules/.bin/jest.cmd --testPathPatterns="badge" (25/25); --testPathPatterns="editor" (45/45); ng build (PASS); git push → pre-push typecheck PASS
Terminal notes: Use node_modules/.bin/jest.cmd not npx jest on Windows; pipe | in --testPathPatterns breaks on cmd, run patterns separately
Next step: Task #1 (in_progress) — Refactor themes.scss: extract universal tokens, add radius/shadow globals, deduplicate dark block


Date: 2026-05-23 [Dark-mode consolidation — eliminated all 4 parallel dark-mode systems]
Changed:
  Component SCSS files — all 20 migrated to inline scoped dark-mode blocks:
  - layout/stack.scss, inline.scss, grid.scss, container.scss
  - icon/icon.scss, alert/alert.scss, badge/badge.scss
  - input/input.scss, select/select.scss, checkbox/checkbox.scss
  - select-button/select-button.scss, tabs/tabs.scss
  - accordion/accordion.scss, accordion/accordion-panel.scss
  - radio-button/radio-button.scss, rating/rating.scss
  - toggle-switch/toggle-switch.scss (replaced @include with inline tokens)
  - card/card.scss (replaced @include + standardized selector to ui-lib-card)
  - dialog/dialog.component.scss (replaced @include + standardized media-query selector)
  - button/button.scss (30-token mixin inlined; bare hex → var(--uilib-color-neutral-950, #0b1220))
  Pattern: [data-theme='dark'] ui-lib-<component> { } + @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) block
  styles/dark-theme.scss → emptied (was opt-in mixin aggregator; now superseded)
  styles/light-theme.scss → emptied (tokens in themes.scss Section 2)
  styles/_theme-mixins.scss → zero consumers; safe to delete
State: 6040/6040 tests pass (226 suites). ng build ui-lib-custom → zero warnings/errors.
Verification: npm test → 6040/6040; npm run build → PASS
Terminal notes: Use node_modules/.bin/jest.cmd not npx jest on Windows
Next step: Delete _theme-mixins.scss (confirmed zero consumers). Then: runtime variant switcher; CSS @layer adoption.
