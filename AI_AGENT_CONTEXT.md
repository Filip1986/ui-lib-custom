## Purpose and Scope

Use this file for:
- Current focus, queue, and blockers
- Quick status deltas for in-flight components/docs
- Recent handoffs (latest 1-3 sessions)

Do not duplicate stable project rules here; link to `AGENTS.md` instead.

## Active Session State

- **Current milestone:** Component foundation hardening + documentation completeness
- **Active focus:** Ripple accessibility hardening COMPLETE (6-phase, #74); BlockUI (#64), BottomSheet (#76), Card (#51), Chart (#72), Chip (#54), ContextMenu (#14) also merged
- **Next queue:** TreeTable hardening (Tier 4, #33) — `role=treegrid`, hierarchy semantics, expanded state, keyboard navigation
- **Horizon:** Runtime variant switcher, theme preset management, broader axe-core audit ✅ (infra in place)
- **Prompt library status:** 48 session hardening prompts created (2026-05-11) for all queued components (#14–#76). Index: `docs/prompts/HARDENING_PROMPT_INDEX.md`. Accumulated lessons documented in `docs/prompts/COMPONENT_EVOLUTION_PROMPTS.md`.

## Known Blockers / Watch Items

- Non-blocking Jest warning seen during a11y run:
  - `jest-haste-map: Haste module naming collision: ui-lib-custom`
  - between root `package.json` and `projects/ui-lib-custom/package.json`
- Demo build shows pre-existing SCSS budget warnings in `button` and `date-picker` -- not a blocker

## Recent Handoffs

Date: 2026-05-12 [MeterGroup component — accessibility hardening COMPLETE (#57)]
Changed:
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/meter-group/meter-group.ts
      • Added module-level `nextMeterGroupId` counter and unique host `instanceId`
      • Added `ariaLabel` input and wired group ARIA label to template
      • Fixed segment percentage calculation to respect `min`/`max` range (`(value - min) / (max - min)`)
      • Added computed `totalValue` + `totalAnnouncement` for live total announcements
      • Added stable segment track helper and richer per-segment aria-label formatter
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/meter-group/meter-group.html
      • Updated segment `@for` loops to use stable track keys
      • Bound group `aria-label` to `ariaLabel` input
      • Updated segment `aria-label` output to include value-range phrasing
      • Added polite/atomic live region for total announcement text
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/meter-group/meter-group.scss
      • Added visually-hidden live-region utility class
      • Added `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` override to disable meter transitions
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/meter-group/meter-group.spec.ts
      • Added tests for custom group aria-label, min/max-relative percentage calculation, and unique host IDs
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/meter-group/meter-group.a11y.spec.ts (CREATED — 18 tests)
      • Added ARIA structure, decorative aria-hidden, live region total updates, keyboard non-focusability, unique IDs, and axe checks
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/meter-group/README.md
      • Added `ariaLabel` input docs, ARIA attributes table, keyboard interaction table, and expanded accessibility notes
  - docs/COMPONENT_SCORES.md
      • MeterGroup #57 queue status: ⏳ Queued → ✅ Done
      • MeterGroup score row populated (API 8, A11y 9, Perf 8, Comp 8, Theme 8, DX 8, Docs 9, Polish 8, Angular 9, Feel 8 — avg 8.3)
State: MeterGroup hardening complete. Segment ARIA labels now include value context, totals are announced through a live region, unique instance IDs are generated, reduced-motion support is in place, and dedicated a11y regression coverage is added.
Verification:
  node_modules/.bin/eslint projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/meter-group/ --max-warnings 0 (PASS)
  node_modules/.bin/jest --testPathPatterns=meter-group --no-coverage (45/45 PASS — 27 unit + 18 a11y)
  node_modules/.bin/ng build ui-lib-custom (PASS, zero errors)
  node_modules/.bin/jest --testPathPatterns=entry-points --no-coverage (97/97 PASS)
Terminal notes: Fresh clone required `npm install`; screenshot captured at `/tmp/meter-group-hardening.png`.
Next step: TreeTable (#33) hardening — Tier 4 Data Display treegrid pass.

Date: 2026-05-12 [Merge conflict resolution for glass-shadow button PR]
Changed:
  - AI_AGENT_CONTEXT.md
      • Resolved merge conflict by preserving the newest three handoffs in active context
      • Added this merge-resolution handoff and kept recent session state concise
  - docs/implementation/AI_AGENT_CONTEXT_ARCHIVE.md
      • Archived the displaced older handoff during the merge resolution
  - tsconfig.json
      • Added `compilerOptions.ignoreDeprecations: "5.0"` so the TypeScript 5.9 pre-push `npm run typecheck` hook passes with the existing `baseUrl` setting
State: Branch is merged with the latest origin/main. Merge conflicts were limited to session-context files, and the pre-push typecheck blocker was resolved without changing application logic.
Verification:
  npm install (PASS)
  npm run typecheck (PASS)
Terminal notes: Repository was a shallow clone, so `git fetch --unshallow origin` and `git fetch origin main:refs/remotes/origin/main` were required before merging. Initial typecheck first failed on the `baseUrl` deprecation gate, and then on missing local packages until `npm install` was rerun.
Next step: Continue with the next queued component hardening item once this PR is mergeable again.

Date: 2026-05-12 [Button component — glass-shadow appearance polish]
Changed:
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/button/button.scss
      • Exposed remaining glass-shadow style values as CSS custom properties (`active-x/y`, font weight, letter spacing, gradient angle, opacity)
      • Replaced remaining hardcoded glass-shadow active/gradient/opacity values with token usage
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/button/button.spec.ts
      • Added `glass-shadow` coverage to the appearance class regression test matrix
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/button/button.ts
      • Updated component description to reflect 12 appearances
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/button/README.md
      • Updated appearance count math, documented `glass-shadow`, and added a usage example
  - projects/demo/src/app/pages/buttons/buttons.component.html
      • Updated demo copy to 12 appearances
      • Wired the dedicated Glass Shadow demo buttons to the active variant switcher
State: Glass-shadow button appearance is fully wired with tokenized styling values, docs/test coverage, and a variant-aware demo section. No broader button hardening work was started.
Verification:
  npm install (PASS)
  node_modules/.bin/eslint projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/button/ projects/demo/src/app/pages/buttons/ --max-warnings 0 (PASS)
  node_modules/.bin/jest --testPathPatterns=projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/button --no-coverage (48/48 PASS)
  node_modules/.bin/ng build ui-lib-custom (PASS)
Terminal notes: Fresh clone required `npm install` before validation. An initial ESLint retry using `--ext .ts,.scss,.html` failed by parsing SCSS with the wrong parser; the repository's standard directory-based ESLint command succeeded. Captured the updated demo screenshot after starting `npm run serve:demo` and installing Playwright Chromium locally.
Next step: Resume the queued hardening track with TreeTable (#33) when button appearance follow-up is no longer needed.

Date: 2026-05-12 [ProgressSpinner — 6-phase hardening COMPLETE (#56)]
Changed:
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/progress-spinner/progress-spinner.ts
      • Added module-level `let nextProgressSpinnerId: number = 0` counter
      • Added `public readonly spinnerId: string` bound to host `[attr.id]`
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/progress-spinner/progress-spinner.html
      • Added `aria-hidden="true"` and `focusable="false"` to the `<svg>` element
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/progress-spinner/progress-spinner.scss
      • Added dark mode overrides for bootstrap and minimal variant arc colours
      • Added `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` block — disables both rotate and dash animations, holds arc at fixed partial draw
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/progress-spinner/progress-spinner.a11y.spec.ts (CREATED — 16 tests)
      • ARIA structure (role, aria-label, aria-busy, SVG aria-hidden, focusable, unique id)
      • ariaLabel reactive updates, two-instance ID uniqueness
      • Visual state (size classes sm/lg)
      • axe-core automated checks (5 states)
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/progress-spinner/README.md
      • Full rewrite: ARIA attributes table, keyboard section, reduced-motion note, screen reader UX guidance, dark mode CSS vars
  - docs/COMPONENT_SCORES.md
      • ProgressSpinner #56: ⏳ Queued → ✅ Done; scores API 9, A11y 9, Perf 9, Comp 8, Theme 9, DX 9, Docs 9, Polish 9, Angular 9, Feel 9 — avg 8.9
State: ProgressSpinner hardening complete. SVG aria-hidden, unique instance IDs, prefers-reduced-motion, dark mode, and 16-test a11y regression suite all in place.
Verification:
  node_modules/.bin/eslint projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/progress-spinner/ --max-warnings 0 (PASS)
  node_modules/.bin/jest --testPathPatterns=progress-spinner --no-coverage (35/35 PASS — 19 unit + 16 a11y)
  node_modules/.bin/ng build ui-lib-custom (PASS, zero errors)
  node_modules/.bin/jest --testPathPatterns=entry-points --no-coverage (97/97 PASS)
Terminal notes: Dark mode SCSS nesting was invalid — had to write explicit flat selectors instead of `&--variant-*` nesting inside `[data-theme='dark'] .ui-lib-progress-spinner`.
Next step: MeterGroup (#57) hardening — Tier 6 Feedback, segment aria-label values, totals announced.

Date: 2026-05-11 [BlockUI component — accessibility hardening COMPLETE (#64)]
Changed:
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/block-ui/block-ui.ts
      • Added module-level `let nextBlockUiId: number = 0` counter
      • Added `public readonly instanceId: string` (unique per-instance, bound to host `[attr.id]`)
      • Added `[attr.aria-disabled]: 'blocked() ? true : null'` to host bindings
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/block-ui/block-ui.html
      • Wrapped default `<ng-content>` in `<div class="ui-lib-block-ui__content">` with `[attr.inert]="blocked() ? '' : null"` to prevent keyboard focus entering blocked content
      • Fixed `[attr.aria-hidden]` on mask: now `null` when blocked (removes attribute), `'true'` when not blocked
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/block-ui/block-ui.scss
      • Added `.ui-lib-block-ui__content { display: contents; }` for zero layout side-effects
      • Added `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` override to disable mask transition
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/block-ui/block-ui.spec.ts
      • Updated `aria-hidden` assertion for blocked state (was 'false', now toBeNull)
      • Added tests for `aria-disabled`, `inert` on content wrapper, and unique host id
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/block-ui/block-ui.a11y.spec.ts (CREATED — 15 tests)
      • ARIA structure, focus-trap/inert, reactive unblock, axe-core (unblocked + blocked states)
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/block-ui/README.md
      • Added ARIA attributes table, keyboard interaction table, CSS custom properties table, and accessibility notes section
  - docs/COMPONENT_SCORES.md
      • BlockUI: ⏳ Queued → ✅ Done; score 9.0/10 across all 10 categories
State: BlockUI hardening complete. Focus trap via `inert`, aria-busy + aria-disabled, unique instance IDs,
  prefers-reduced-motion support, and dedicated a11y regression coverage are in place.
Verification:
  node_modules/.bin/eslint projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/block-ui/ --max-warnings 0 (PASS)
  node_modules/.bin/jest --testPathPatterns=block-ui --no-coverage (38/38 PASS)
  node_modules/.bin/ng build ui-lib-custom (PASS, zero errors)
  node_modules/.bin/jest --testPathPatterns=entry-points --no-coverage (97/97 PASS)
Terminal notes: Fresh clone required `npm install` before validation.
Next step: TreeTable (#33) hardening — start Tier 4 Data Display treegrid pass.

Date: 2026-05-11 [BottomSheet component — accessibility hardening COMPLETE (#76)]
Changed:
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/bottom-sheet/bottom-sheet.ts
      • Added module-level `nextBottomSheetId` counter; exposed `instanceId` and `titleId` as unique per-instance strings
      • Imported `isPlatformBrowser` from `@angular/common` and `PLATFORM_ID` for SSR safety
      • Imported `FocusTrap` from `ui-lib-custom/core`; replaced `panel?.focus()` with full focus trap lifecycle (activate on open, deactivate on close with automatic focus restoration)
      • Added `private focusTrap: FocusTrap | null = null` field
      • Added `activateFocusTrap()` and `deactivateFocusTrap()` private methods
      • Wired `deactivateFocusTrap()` into `ngOnDestroy` to prevent memory leaks
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/bottom-sheet/bottom-sheet.html
      • Switched `[attr.aria-label]` → `[attr.aria-labelledby]` referencing `titleId`
      • Added `[id]="titleId"` to the title span for the ARIA association
      • Removed redundant `[attr.aria-hidden]` from the panel (host-level `aria-hidden` is sufficient)
      • Replaced `<span class="pi pi-times">` close icon with an inline SVG (`aria-hidden="true"`, `focusable="false"`)
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/bottom-sheet/bottom-sheet.scss
      • Added `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` block disabling all transitions on panel, backdrop, and close button
      • Added `.ui-lib-bottom-sheet__close-icon` display rule for the SVG
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/bottom-sheet/bottom-sheet.a11y.spec.ts (CREATED — 24 tests)
      • axe-core checks (3), ARIA attribute assertions (11), focus management (4), keyboard interaction (2), unique ID (2)
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/bottom-sheet/README.md
      • Added ARIA attributes table, keyboard interactions table, expanded CSS custom properties table, and updated accessibility section
  - docs/COMPONENT_SCORES.md
      • BottomSheet #76: ⏳ Queued → ✅ Done; score row populated (API 8, A11y 9, Perf 8, Comp 8, Theme 9, DX 9, Docs 9, Polish 8, Angular 9, Feel 8 — avg 8.5)
State: BottomSheet hardening complete. Full focus trap with restoration, aria-labelledby with unique per-instance IDs, reduced-motion support, SVG close icon, and 24-test a11y regression suite are in place.
Verification:
  node_modules/.bin/eslint projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/bottom-sheet/ --max-warnings 0 (PASS)
  node_modules/.bin/jest --testPathPatterns=bottom-sheet --no-coverage (50/50 PASS — 26 unit + 24 a11y)
  node_modules/.bin/ng build ui-lib-custom (PASS, zero errors)
  node_modules/.bin/jest --testPathPatterns=entry-points --no-coverage (97/97 PASS)
Terminal notes: Fresh clone required `npm install` before validation. `isPlatformBrowser` must be imported from `@angular/common`, not `@angular/core`, to satisfy @typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-call.
Next step: TreeTable (#33) hardening — Tier 4 Data Display treegrid pass.

Date: 2026-05-12 [Ripple directive — accessibility hardening COMPLETE (#74)]
Changed:
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/ripple/ripple.ts
      • Imported `PLATFORM_ID` from `@angular/core` and `isPlatformBrowser` from `@angular/common`
      • Added `private readonly platformId: object = inject(PLATFORM_ID)` field
      • Added `isPlatformBrowser` guard in `ngOnInit` — click listener only registered in browser environments (SSR safety)
      • Added `private prefersReducedMotion(): boolean` method — checks `window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)').matches`
      • Added early return in `spawnWave()` when `prefersReducedMotion()` is true — wave element is never created (not just instant)
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/ripple/ripple.scss
      • Added `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` block with `animation: none; display: none` on `.ui-lib-ripple-wave` (defence-in-depth)
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/ripple/ripple.a11y.spec.ts (CREATED — 10 tests)
      • axe-core checks: basic, disabled, after-wave-spawn
      • Decorative: no ARIA role, no aria-label/aria-labelledby added to host
      • Wave span contains no text content
      • Reduced motion: wave NOT spawned when matchMedia returns true; wave IS spawned when false
      • Keyboard: simulated click (Enter/Space) triggers wave
      • Disabled: no wave spawned
      • Multi-instance: passes axe; waves confined to own host
  - projects/ui-lib-custom/src/lib/ripple/README.md
      • Added ARIA attributes table (none — purely decorative)
      • Added keyboard interaction table (Enter/Space via native click)
      • Renamed "CSS variables" section to "CSS custom properties"
      • Expanded Accessibility section with reduced-motion dual-layer explanation, screen reader note, SSR safety note
  - docs/COMPONENT_SCORES.md
      • Ripple #74: ⏳ Queued → ✅ Done; score row populated (API 8, A11y 9, Perf 9, Comp 8, Theme 8, DX 9, Docs 9, Polish 9, Angular 9, Feel 9 — avg 8.7)
State: Ripple hardening complete. prefers-reduced-motion fully suppresses wave creation (JS + CSS), SSR safe, 10-test a11y regression suite in place.
