# AI Agent Context

> Active session context only.
> Stable architecture, conventions, and workflows live in `AGENTS.md`.
> Historical handoffs live in `docs/implementation/AI_AGENT_CONTEXT_ARCHIVE.md`.

## Purpose and Scope

Use this file for:
- Current focus, queue, and blockers
- Quick status deltas for in-flight components/docs
- Recent handoffs (latest 1-3 sessions)

Do not duplicate stable project rules here; link to `AGENTS.md` instead.

## Active Session State

- **Current milestone:** Component foundation hardening + documentation completeness
- **Active focus:** ScrollTop (#75), ScrollPanel (#62), SplitButton (#68), TreeTable (#33), Tree (#34), Timeline (#71) and Upload (#69) accessibility hardening COMPLETE (6-phase); Tag (#53), ProgressSpinner (#56), Panel (#60), MeterGroup (#57), Ripple (#74), BlockUI (#64), BottomSheet (#76), Card (#51), Chart (#72), Chip (#54), ContextMenu (#14) also merged
- **Next queue:** TreeSelect hardening (Tier 4, #35) — combobox + tree popup pattern
- **Horizon:** Runtime variant switcher, theme preset management, broader axe-core audit ✅ (infra in place)
- **Prompt library status:** 48 session hardening prompts created (2026-05-11) for all queued components (#14–#76). Index: `docs/prompts/HARDENING_PROMPT_INDEX.md`. Accumulated lessons documented in `docs/prompts/COMPONENT_EVOLUTION_PROMPTS.md`.

## Known Blockers / Watch Items

- Non-blocking Jest warning seen during a11y run:
  - `jest-haste-map: Haste module naming collision: ui-lib-custom`
  - between root `package.json` and `projects/ui-lib-custom/package.json`
- Demo build shows pre-existing SCSS budget warnings in `button` and `date-picker` -- not a blocker

## Recent Handoffs

Date: 2026-05-12 [SplitButton PR — merge conflict resolution COMPLETE (round 5)]
Changed:
  - AI_AGENT_CONTEXT.md
      • Resolved additive handoff conflicts against the newer upstream tracking state from `origin/main`
      • Kept only the newest 3 active handoffs by moving the older Skeleton merge-resolution handoff into the archive
  - docs/COMPONENT_SCORES.md
      • Preserved SplitButton #68 as ✅ Done while keeping upstream Terminal #70 as ✅ Done
  - docs/implementation/AI_AGENT_CONTEXT_ARCHIVE.md
      • Preserved the existing SplitButton/ScrollTop archive history and archived the older Skeleton round-2 merge handoff from the active context
State: The SplitButton PR branch now reconciles the latest `origin/main` tracking-file conflicts without losing existing SplitButton completion records or the newer upstream bookkeeping from main.
Verification:
  node_modules/.bin/jest --testPathPatterns='split-button|terminal|entry-points' --no-coverage (PASS)
  npm run typecheck (PASS)
  node_modules/.bin/ng build ui-lib-custom (PASS, zero errors)
Terminal notes: Fresh clone was shallow again, so `git fetch --unshallow origin` and `git fetch origin main:refs/remotes/origin/main` were required before the real merge. Fresh session also required `npm install` before Jest and the pinned local TypeScript toolchain were available.
Next step: No further action for this PR unless `origin/main` advances again and introduces new conflicts.

      • Preserved SplitButton #68 as ✅ Done while keeping upstream Skeleton/ScrollTop status updates intact
  - docs/implementation/AI_AGENT_CONTEXT_ARCHIVE.md
